<Prolog>
Dusk sets in as I walk the rocky road, in mids the slump. 
Leo
I'm so hungry

I mutter to my self. It has been weeks since, I have been living on the roads by now.
Leo
I would have stole some money, if I knew it was going to be this bad. Its not like I cared for them anyways.

Few Weeks ago, I ran away from my home. My families were just a collection of insane people, with father being the worst. Coming from the mage family who practices polygami, my father had always kept distance from my mother and me, including the times when my mother was always fatally sick. And fathers lack of affection meant as invitation for my other siblings to bully us. I.... did not fight back, for my mother did not want to see me get into a fight. However circumstances had changed after my 13th birthday
Leo
How are your fever?
Mother
It feels much better, since you gave me some pills.
Leo
Well just take it easy, and call me if you need anything, I won't be far away
Mother
Leo?
Leo
what is it?
Mother
I just wanted to say.... That Im sorry for all the bad things you had to go through.
Leo
What are you.... Oh you mean the other kids stuffing dead rats in my shes for my birthday? It doesn't bother me. They are just imature kids after all.
Mother
.... I always felt that I had chained you down to this place. When I think that you might have had a happier life under a normal family, I always felt guilty.
Leo
Mom Its ok, I....
Mother
I hope you do not resent me.... Being last line of my heritage, I had no choice but to join this household. After all, thats what my father had told me to do....
Leo
....
Leo
I understand that as a mage's blood line, you did not have a choice in your marriage. And I will never think that you had brought me any of my misfortune.
Mother
I'm relieved to hear that. But I hope that someday.... That someday, you will be relieved of your burdens and find what you truly want to do.
Leo
I thinks you are jumping the gun way too far ahead mom. I'm only 13 remember?
Mother
Right. You act too mature that I forget that sometimes.
Mother
I think I need some rest. But more importantly, you barely had any sleep last night. Why dont you go take a little nap? I should be fine untill then.
Leo
But what if...
Mother
Dont jinx it. I took some pills, so I should be alright.
Leo
alright I'll do that for now.
Mother
only 13....
